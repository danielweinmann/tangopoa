# Rails 3.1 Project Bootstrap
      
  To start a new project just:

    git clone git@github.com:softa/bootstrap-31.git cool_name_of_my_new_project

  Then you'll need to replace the Bootstrap application name for your app name.
  And then just change the origin ref in .git/config and push it to your new repo.
